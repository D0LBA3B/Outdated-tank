# Outdated Tank

Welcome to **Outdated Tank**, a 2D grid-based tank battle game written in **Scala**. Think of it as a battle royale for vintage tanks with outdated tech but unlimited firepower.

## Concept

In **Outdated Tank**, players control tanks that fight for dominance on a grid-based battlefield. The game is simple but strategic:

- Each tank moves across a 2D grid, aiming to outwit and outshoot opponents.
- Firepower is unlimited, but you have a cooldown limit
- Destroy other tanks and claim the grid as your own!
